# A Wedding Registry<br><sup> as simple as possible</sup>

This is a wedding gift list app done as simply as possible
The couple can add gifts to the list and guest can mark them as bought.

That's it. No more, no less.
No bells, no faff, no nonsense. (And also not really any security, so don't use this for anything important!)
